	<h3>Directions</h3>
	<p>
	<b>Step 1</b><br>Preheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or heatproof platter 	ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. In a small bowl, whisk together 	flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Step 2</b><br>In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg. 	Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened (do not overmix; a 	few small lumps are fine).
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Step 3</b><br>Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium. 	Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; carefully rub skillet with 	oiled paper towel.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Step 4</b><br>For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, 	using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you should be able to fit 2 	to 3 in a large skillet).
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>Step 5</b><br>Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have 	burst, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the 	underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely 	with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. Continue with more oil and remaining 	batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired toppings.
